Greetings and salutations to thee, fellow human! I like to code and play video games, among other less exciting hobbies.

I recently graduated from the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/) with a Bachelors of Arts (December 2020) after spending five years studying business, political science, and economics. Immediately afterwards, I partook in a six month coding boot camp offered by the [University of Toronto School of Continuing Studies](https://learn.utoronto.ca/) (May 2021). There, I studied front and back-end development. It'd be silly to say I've mastered everything I learned, but I can confidently say that I am at least competent in the following:

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React
- Node.js, Express
- MySQL, Sequelize, Mongoose

üå± Currently, I'm investigating the mystical powers of:

- PostgreSQL (*"It's basically MongoDB, but better in every way."* - a friend)
- Next.js (Components, preprocessing, link routing, oh my!)
- Sass (‚ù§Ô∏è *@mixin*s. Where were you when I needed to automate my breakpoints?)

While I am flounder about, trying to get a stronger grip in the world of development, I am working on the following projects:

- [discord-rpg-game](https://github.com/TerrenceJChan/discord-rpg-game) - An adventure RPG that can be played solo or with friends on Discord. (Collaboration project with my friend [@foxfriends](https://github.com/foxfriends).)
- [next-portfolio](https://github.com/TerrenceJChan/next-portfolio) - My third iteration of creating a nice home on the internet. Doubles as an experiment ground to learn Next.js and Sass.

I've always wanted to get into art as a child, but the idea of getting sticky with paint and drawing lines without rulers terrified me to the core. I treat coding as my outlet of finally being able to unleash my creativity while creating something that might be of use to someone.

## Contact

I can be reached at not one, but _two_ different places! I check my email [contact@terrencejchan.com](contact@terrencejchan.com) every day, and I can easily be reached on [Discord](https://discord.com/) via **@Hycic#2025** for a casual chat. I promise that my speaking voice is more pleasant than my writing voice.
